# SBSPS-Challenge-1198-AI-Recruiter--Shortlist-a-suitable-candidate-for-a-specific-Job-role.


AI Recruiter- 
Recruiters from a company receive thousands of applications for a particular role in a company and there are multiple roles in a single organization. Hence the need for automation of this task is very much needed at the moment so that the right person is selected for the job.

As it must be clear from the name, I will work on building an AI based recruiting system which will help simplify the recruiting process of HRs and all other form of recruiters by providing an AI based shortlisting model. It may sound very biased but actually the final selection will be done by a real human only. My model will only help the recruiter in the initial shortlisting process to gain the necessary idea about the nature of the candidate who has applied for it and help him/her ease the intial shortlisting process.
