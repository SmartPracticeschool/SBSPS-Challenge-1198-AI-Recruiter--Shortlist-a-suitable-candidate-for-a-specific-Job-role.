# SBSPS-Challenge-1198-AI-Recruiter--Shortlist-a-suitable-candidate-for-a-specific-Job-role.


<B>AI Recruiter</B>- 
Recruiters from a company receive thousands of applications for a particular role in a company and there are multiple roles in a single organization. Hence the need for automation of this task is very much needed at the moment so that the right person is selected for the job.

As it must be clear from the name, I will work on building an AI based recruiting system which will help simplify the recruiting process of HRs and all other form of recruiters by providing an AI based shortlisting model. It may sound very biased but actually the final selection will be done by a real human only. My model will only help the recruiter in the initial shortlisting process to gain the necessary idea about the nature of the candidate who has applied for it and help him/her ease the intial shortlisting process.   


This Recruiting model will have applications across every industry known as it will be using a CV based shortlisting for the candidate. It can be modified to suit the needs of a particular domain if we are recruiting in that domain but we will go with a more general approach in this one by judging the personality score of a particular candidate. 

The way we will be handling the workflow of the project is that 
1. Gathering/cleaning of data. ( Will try to look for pre-processed data to ease the model functioning from various sources like github, kaggle etc)
2. Data Analyzing- Analyzing the data to derive insights from it about the candidate. 
3. Data Model- Creating the machine learning model to predict the personality/nature of that particular person with respect to that particular domain.
4. Deploying the Model


Note - Majorcodefinal.py contains all the backend code for this project and the web app is present in the flask_app folder.
